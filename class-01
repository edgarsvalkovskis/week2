## Getting Started:
1.  Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.

Through the HTTP protocol, **resources are exchanged between client devices and servers over the internet**. Client devices send requests to servers for the resources needed to load a web page; the servers send responses back to the client to fulfill the requests.

2.  Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.

3.  How can you find images to add to a Website?

*You can find images on the world wide web or use the ones that is held on your local computer.*

## Introduction to HTML

1.  What is an HTML attribute?
**Points to remember for attributes:**

-   Attributes always come in name/value pairs like this: attribute_name=”value”.
-   Attributes are always added to the start tag of an HTML element.
-   Attribute values should always be enclosed in quotes. Double style quotes (“ ”) are the most common, but single style quotes (‘ ’) are also allowed.
-   In some rare situations, like when the attribute value itself contains quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes: name=’John “ShotGun” Nelson’ and vice-versa.

2.  Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element.

3.  What is the Difference between  `<article>`  and  `<section>`  element tags? Semantic Tags
**The article element specifies independent, self-contained content.**  **The  section  element defines section in a document**.

4.  What Elements does a “typical” website include?
[https://www.wix.com/blog/parts-of-a-website](https://www.wix.com/blog/parts-of-a-website) 

-   **header:**  [`<header>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header).
-   **navigation bar:**  [`<nav>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/nav).
-   **main content:**  [`<main>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main), with various content subsections represented by  [`<article>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/article),  [`<section>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/section), and  [`<div>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/div)  elements.
-   **sidebar:**  [`<aside>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/aside); often placed inside  [`<main>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/main).
-   **footer:**  [`<footer>`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer).
5.  How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?

Using metadata **boosts your SEO efforts because it's written in the search engine's language**. This helps search engines better understand the topic of your web pages and content. It also helps them display more relevant results to searchers.

6.  How is the  `<meta>`  HTML tag used when specifying metadata?

`meta` tags represent metadata. They are essentially used for defining and describing data about data, and are used to add extra information to the data inside the webpage.

## Miscellaneous

1.  What is the first step to designing a Website?

When you get an idea and want to turn it into a website, there are a few questions you should answer before anything else:

-   What exactly do I want to accomplish?
-   How will a website help me reach my goals?
-   What needs to be done, and in what order, to reach my goals?

All of this is called  _project ideation_  and is a necessary first step to reach your goal, whether you are a beginner or an experienced developer.

***What exactly do I want to accomplish?***

## Semantics
[HTML5 Semantic Markup Tags & Layout - HTML Tutorial for Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXCbjS2fxzU&ab_channel=PixemWeb)

1.  Why should you use an  `<h1>`  element over a  `<span>`  element to display a top level heading?
< span > has no meaning other than to serve as a tool to style in CSS. **When using < h1 > this will already have, for example, a set font-weight which will be interpreted by the browser**.
2.  What are the benefits of using semantic tags in our HTML?
-   Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings
-   Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page
-   Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier than searching through endless  `div`s with or without semantic or namespaced classes
-   Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated
-   Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming

## What is JavaScript?

1.  Describe 2 things that  _require_  JavaScript in the Browser?
